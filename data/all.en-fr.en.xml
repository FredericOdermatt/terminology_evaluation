<seg id="991"> to implement this the UK government has recently articulated the desire to implement population self-isolation measures . </seg>

<seg id="994"> key to the focus of our study will be the estimation of peak cases in the population and continual monitoring by data collection and modelling the potential growth and emergence of subsequent peaks in new cases as <term id="291" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="social distancing measures" tgt="mesures de distanciation sociale"> social distancing measures </term> are relaxed . </seg>

<seg id="996"> a further fundamental measure in <term id="260" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="pandemic" tgt="pandémie"> pandemic </term> dynamics is the length of time from <term id="331" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="infection" tgt="infections|infectées|infection"> infection </term> to when a person is <term id="465" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="infectious" tgt="infectieux"> infectious </term> to others and the mean duration of infectiousness . </seg>

<seg id="998"> we intend to apply approximate Bayesian inference ( ABC ) to ( possibly spatially heterogeneous ) Susceptible-Exposed- Infectious-Removed ( SEIR ) stochastic <term id="202" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="epidemic" tgt="épidémie|épidémique|épidémiques"> epidemic </term> models . </seg>
<seg id="999"> such techniques are highly parallelizable and have been successfully applied to many fields including disease <term id="16" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="transmission" tgt="transmission"> transmission </term> modelling . </seg>
<seg id="1000"> they are particularly suited to situations where likelihood functions are absent and where more traditional approaches such as Markov chain Monte Carlo are impractical . </seg>
<seg id="1001"> such an approach has been demonstrated to work effectively on the ASPREN surveillance data , a network of sentinel GPs and nurse practitioners who report deidentified information on ILIs and other conditions , where issues such as missing data and the need to model the observation process itself has been successfully addressed . </seg>
<seg id="1002"> furthermore , peaks in new cases have been estimated by distributional methods . </seg>
<seg id="1003"> estimates of the parameters of the SEIR model are tractable on large data sets because of parallelizability , and these methods have been implemented in several R libraries ; we intend to use the libraries ABSEIR ( deposited on GitHub : https : / / tinyurl.com / vqu35cj ) and abctools ( https : / / tinyurl.com / tfjavz4 ) to estimate <term id="202" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="epidemic" tgt="épidémie|épidémique|épidémiques"> epidemic </term> measures on a weekly basis . </seg>
<seg id="1004"> since we are fitting an SIR-epidemic model in the ABC routine , we anticipate that our results will be robust against weekly case data containing relatively small counts . </seg>
<seg id="1005"> for example , see for the ABC methodology applied to the Tristan da Cunha <term id="340" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="common cold" tgt="rhume commun|rhumes communs|rhume"> common cold </term> data from 1967 , where counts of I ( number of <term id="465" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="infectious" tgt="infectieux"> infectious </term> cases ) and R ( number of recovered cases ) are in the tens at most . </seg>
<seg id="1006"> finally , in addition to the above methodology we will employ the Kaplan-Meier method with two outcomes ( death and recovery ) to estimate the case fatality ratio . </seg>

<seg id="1127"> on Wednesday , Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one pack per order . </seg>
<seg id="1128"> these changes followed the previous four-pack per transaction restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively . </seg>
<seg id="1129"> Coles , in its March 8 media release , reported that with the four-pack restriction in place , " many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery " , and called the demand " unprecedented " , while ALDI , in a Facebook post on Tuesday , called it " unexpected " . </seg>
<seg id="1130"> sales went up in a " sharp increase " last week , according to a Woolworths spokesperson . </seg>
<seg id="1131"> Costco 's store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packs last week . </seg>

<seg id="1138"> Coles and Woolworths have a view [ that ] if there was plenty of stuff on the shelf , if product like toilet rolls and sanitiser could be [ bought ] and are there in quantities , you would probably minimise the panic said Russell Zimmerman per ABC News . </seg>

<seg id="1918"> as of 29 March , nearly 90 % of the world 's learners were impacted by closures.Even when school closures are temporary , it carries high social and economic costs . </seg>
<seg id="1919"> the disruptions they cause affect people across communities , but their impact is more severe for disadvantaged children and their families including interrupted learning , compromised nutrition , childcare problems and consequent economic cost to families who cannot work . </seg>
<seg id="1920"> working parents are more likely to miss work when schools close in order to take care of their children , incurring wage loss in many instances and negatively impacting productivity . </seg>
<seg id="1921"> localised school closures place burdens on schools as parents and officials redirect children to schools that are open . </seg>
<seg id="1922"> women often represent a large share of health-care workers and often cannot attend work because of childcare obligations that result from school closures . </seg>
<seg id="1923"> this means that many medical professionals are not at the facilities where they are most needed during a <term id="449" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="health crisis" tgt="crise sanitaire"> health crisis </term> . </seg>
<seg id="1924"> lack of access to technology or fast , reliable internet access can prevent students in rural areas and from disadvantaged families . </seg>

<seg id="1926"> in response to school closures caused by COVID-19 , UNESCO recommends the use of distance learning programmes and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.To aid in slowing the <term id="16" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="transmission" tgt="transmission"> transmission </term> of COVID-19 , hundreds of libraries have temporarily closed . </seg>
<seg id="1927"> in the United States , numerous major cities announced public library closures , including Los Angeles , San Francisco , Seattle , and New York City , affecting 221 libraries . </seg>
<seg id="1928"> for students without internet at home , this increases the difficulty of keeping up with distance learning . </seg>
<seg id="1929"> school closures puts a strain on parents and guardians to provide childcare and manage distance learning while children are out of school . </seg>
<seg id="1930"> in the absence of alternative options , working parents often leave children alone when schools close and this can lead to risky behaviours , including increased influence of peer pressure and substance abuse . </seg>
<seg id="1931"> many children worldwide rely on free or discounted meals at schools . </seg>
<seg id="1932"> when schools close , nutrition is compromised.Nutrition plays a critical role in cognitive development and academic performance for children.In Washington State , around 45 % of the states 1.1 million students enrolled in traditional public and charter schools qualify for subsidised school meals . </seg>
<seg id="1933"> at least 520,000 students and their families may be affected by food insecurity as a result of school closures.School lunch programmes are the second-biggest anti-hunger initiative in the United States after food stamps . </seg>
<seg id="1934"> every year , nearly 30 million children rely on schools to provide free or low-cost meals including breakfast , lunch , snacks , and even dinner.In Alabama , where state-wide school closures as of 18 March have affected over 720,000 students , the state Superintendent announced that staff in schools disproportionately affected by poverty would create meal distribution networks to provide food for students who rely on school lunches . </seg>
<seg id="1935"> school closures negatively impact student learning outcomes . </seg>
<seg id="1936"> schooling provides essential learning and when schools close , children and youth are deprived opportunities for growth and development . </seg>
<seg id="1937"> the disadvantages are disproportionate for under-privileged learners who tend to have fewer educational opportunities beyond school.Student drop-out rates tend to increase as an effect of school closures due to the challenge of ensuring all students return to school once school closures ends . </seg>
<seg id="1938"> this is especially true of protracted closures.Schools are hubs of social activity and human interaction . </seg>
<seg id="1939"> when schools are closed , many children and youth miss out of on social contact that is essential to learning and development.When schools close parents are often asked to facilitate the learning of children at home and can struggle to perform this task . </seg>
<seg id="1940"> this is especially true for parents with limited education and resources . </seg>
<seg id="1941"> potential impacts of school closures and reliance on distance learning are not addressed in federal acts of legislation at this time . </seg>
<seg id="1942"> formal education — as opposed to informal education or non-formal education — tends to refer to schools , colleges , universities and training institutions . </seg>
<seg id="1943"> a 1974 report by the World Bank defined formal education as the following : formal education : the hierarchically structured , chronologically graded ‘ education system ’ , running from primary school through the university and including , in addition to general academic studies , a variety of specialised programmes and institutions for full-time technical and professional training.The majority of data collected on the number of students and learners impacted by COVID-19 has been calculated based on the closure of formal education systems . </seg>
<seg id="1944"> the UNESCO Institute for Statistics provides figures on students impacted by COVID-19 corresponding to the number of learners enrolled at pre-primary , primary , lower-secondary , and upper-secondary levels of education [ ISCED levels 0 to 3 ] , as well as at tertiary education levels [ ISCED levels 5 to 8 ] . </seg>
<seg id="1945"> early childhood educational programmes are usually designed for children below the age of 3 and may refer to preschools , nursery schools , kindergartens , and some day care programmes . </seg>
<seg id="1946"> while many primary and secondary schools have closed around the world due to COVID-19 , measures impacting early childhood educational programmes have varied . </seg>
<seg id="1947"> in some countries and territories , preschools and day cares are considered necessary services and have not closed in tandem with broader school closure measures.In the United States , the Washington State Department of Children , Youth , and Families encouraged child care and early learning centres to stay open . </seg>
<seg id="1948"> some school districts may offer alternative child care options , prioritising the children of first responders and healthcare workers . </seg>
<seg id="1949"> the governor of Maryland mandated that specific child care services remain open for the children of emergency personnel while Washington State and California have left it to the discretion of care providers . </seg>
<seg id="1950"> California Governor Gavin Newsom explained his state 's position , saying “ We need our child care facilities , our daycare centers , to operate to absorb the impact of these school closures . ” </seg>
<seg id="1951"> Colorado has encouraged the development of " tool kits " for parents to use at home to emulate the lessons children would have received in their early learning programmes.In Japan , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe closed all schools throughout the country until April 8 , however , children 's daycare facilities were excluded . </seg>
<seg id="1952"> in early March , five adults associated with a nursing facility for preschool children in Kobe tested positive for <term id="6" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="Coronavirus" tgt="coronavirus"> Coronavirus </term> . </seg>
<seg id="1953"> after testing over one hundred children at the facility , a preschool student was found to be carrying the <term id="309" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="virus" tgt="virus|viral"> virus </term> . </seg>
<seg id="1954"> primary or elementary education typically consists of the first four to seven years of formal education . </seg>
<seg id="1955"> the International Baccalaureate Organization ( IBO ) canceled the examinations for its Diploma Programme and career-related Programme candidates scheduled between 30 April and 22 May 2020 , reportedly affecting more than 200,000 students worldwide . </seg>
<seg id="1956"> the IBO stated that it would award candidates their diplomas or certificates based on " their coursework " and " the established assessment expertise , rigor , and quality control already built into the programme . " </seg>
<seg id="1957"> tertiary education , also known as higher education , refers to the non-compulsory educational levels that follow completion of secondary school or high school . </seg>
<seg id="1958"> tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education , as well as vocational education and training . </seg>
<seg id="1959"> individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates , diplomas , or academic degrees . </seg>
<seg id="1960"> undergraduate education is education conducted after secondary education and prior to post-graduate education , for which the learner is typically awarded a bachelor 's degree . </seg>
<seg id="1961"> students enrolled in higher education programmes at colleges , universities , and community colleges are often refereed to in countries such as United States as " college students . " the closure of colleges and universities has widespread implications for students , faculty , administrators , and the institutions themselves . </seg>
<seg id="1962"> colleges and universities across the United States have been called upon to issue refunds to students for the cost of tuition and room and board . </seg>
<seg id="1963"> in the United States of America , Colleges and universities operate as " mini-cities " which generate significant revenue for cities , states , and regions . </seg>
<seg id="1964"> for example , Princeton University contributed $ 1.58 billion USD to the New Jersey economy and students spent about $ 60 million in off-campus spending . </seg>
<seg id="1965"> College and university closures have a domino effect on economies with far-reaching implications.According to Linda Bilmes of the Harvard Kennedy School , " local hotels , restaurants , cafes , shops , car rental agencies and other local businesses obtain a significant share of annual revenue from graduation week and college reunions ... </seg>
<seg id="1966"> these communities will suffer a lot of economic damage if the colleges remain closed at that time . " small towns which rely on college students to support the local economy and provide labour to local businesses are especially impacted by school closures and the exodus of students from campus . </seg>
<seg id="1967"> in Ithaca , New York , Cornell University students spent at least $ 4 million a week in Tompkins county . </seg>
<seg id="1968"> in the wake of Cornell 's decision to keep students home following spring break and transition to virtual instruction , the Mayor of Ithaca called for " immediate and forceful federal action — we will see a horrific economic impact as a result of Cornell University closing . " </seg>
<seg id="1969"> UNESCO is sharing 10 recommendations during this period : </seg>
<seg id="1970"> examine the readiness and choose the most relevant tools : decide on the use high-technology and low-technology solutions based on the reliability of local power supplies , internet connectivity , and digital skills of teachers and students . </seg>
<seg id="1971"> this could range through integrated digital learning platforms , video lessons , MOOCs , to broadcasting through radios and TVs . </seg>
<seg id="1972"> ensure inclusion of the distance learning programmes : implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes , if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices . </seg>
<seg id="1973"> consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity . </seg>
<seg id="1974"> protect data privacy and data security : assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces , as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals . </seg>
<seg id="1975"> ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students ’ data privacy . </seg>
<seg id="1976"> prioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching : mobilize available tools to connect schools , parents , teachers , and students with each other . </seg>
<seg id="1977"> create communities to ensure regular human interactions , enable social caring measures , and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated . </seg>
<seg id="1978"> plan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes : organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students ’ knowledge of prior lessons . </seg>
<seg id="1979"> plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones , level of studies , needs of students needs , and availability of parents . </seg>
<seg id="1980"> choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based <term id="13" type="src_lemma_and_tgt_original" src="quarantine" tgt="mise en quarantaine|placer en quarantaine|quarantaine|quarantaines"> quarantines </term> . </seg>
<seg id="1981"> avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication . </seg>
<seg id="1982"> provide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools : organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well , if monitoring and facilitation are needed . </seg>
<seg id="1983"> help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons . </seg>
<seg id="1984"> blend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms : blend tools or media that are available for most students , both for synchronous communication and lessons , and for asynchronous learning . </seg>
<seg id="1985"> avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms . </seg>
<seg id="1986"> develop distance learning rules and monitor students ’ learning process : define the rules with parents and students on distance learning . </seg>
<seg id="1987"> design formative questions , tests , or exercises to monitor closely students ’ learning process . </seg>
<seg id="1988"> try to use tools to support submission of students ’ feedback and avoid overloading parents by requesting them to scan and send students ’ feedback </seg>

<seg id="2076"> the <term id="402" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="COVID-19 epidemic" tgt="épidémie de COVID-19"> COVID-19 epidemic </term> is something that makes clear our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have to one another . </seg>
<seg id="2077"> we don ’ t have precedent for its challenges , but we do know that our best response relies on the sort of global empathy , cooperation , and community building that sits at the heart of this organization . </seg>
<seg id="2078"> the camaraderie and care we have seen among all of our colleagues over email , calls , and chats is a remarkable validation of the incredible humans we are fortunate enough to work with . </seg>
<seg id="2079"> I couldn ’ t be more grateful and proud to count you all as colleagues . </seg>
<seg id="2080"> last week , someone shared with me their appreciation for our work . </seg>
<seg id="2081"> they reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now , and what a powerful symbol it is for this critical resource to remain online and available to all . </seg>
<seg id="2082"> your work makes this possible , whether you keep the sites stay up or our colleagues paid or our communities safe . </seg>
<seg id="2083"> the world needs the information that Wikipedia provides , now more than ever . </seg>
<seg id="2084"> this is a moment in which not only what we do , but how we do it , will make a meaningful impact on the world . </seg>
<seg id="2085"> because of the importance of this mission and your role in it , we will be making some significant adjustments to how we work together , starting this coming week . </seg>
<seg id="2086"> adjustments to our work and schedules </seg>
<seg id="2087"> as Robyn mentioned previously , the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months . </seg>
<seg id="2088"> in that conversation , we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we ’ re facing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this time . </seg>
<seg id="2089"> overwhelmingly we wanted to remove stress and support our mission for the long term . </seg>
<seg id="2090"> if you need to dial back , that ’ s okay . </seg>
<seg id="2091"> for all staff , contractors , and contract workers : </seg>
<seg id="2092"> our daily working expectations will be about 4 hours a day , or 20 hours a week until further notice . </seg>
<seg id="2093"> we ’ re not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work more normal hours , the mission can use you . </seg>
<seg id="2094"> however , the world is unpredictable right now , and whether you need to care for loved ones , get groceries , or go to the doctor , your well-being is our priority . </seg>
<seg id="2095"> we are not tracking your time . </seg>
<seg id="2096"> if you are sick , do not work . </seg>
<seg id="2097"> this should go without saying , but we ’ re saying it . </seg>
<seg id="2098"> no sick days or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered . </seg>
<seg id="2099"> ( if you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19 , please let Bryan within T & C Ops know so T & C can help with support and make sure your situation gets appropriate attention from management ) . </seg>
<seg id="2100"> hourly folks will be fully paid . </seg>
<seg id="2101"> we have already said , and are recommitting to honor our commitments to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues . </seg>
<seg id="2102"> everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual hours worked during normal circumstances . </seg>
<seg id="2103"> this includes if you are sick and unable to work . </seg>
<seg id="2104"> if you want to work , we support you . </seg>
<seg id="2105"> many people use work as a way of channeling their stress with the world around us . </seg>
<seg id="2106"> what we do can be incredibly rewarding , especially during times like this . </seg>
<seg id="2107"> again , this is about your self-care . </seg>
<seg id="2108"> our ask is that you communicate with your manager , so we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly . </seg>
<seg id="2109"> some work is considered essential . </seg>
<seg id="2110"> there are some things that we must keep doing . </seg>
<seg id="2111"> the SRE , HR Ops , Trust & Safety , and Fundraising teams ( among others ) do critical work that may need additional support . </seg>
<seg id="2112"> we ’ ll begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what ’ s essential for our mission . </seg>
<seg id="2113"> there ’ s plenty to do for all of us , we just will all focus on the most essential projects . </seg>
<seg id="2114"> slowing now won ’ t hurt later . </seg>
<seg id="2115"> we do not plan to go “ double-time to catch up ” once the <term id="260" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="pandemic" tgt="pandémie"> pandemic </term> has passed . </seg>
<seg id="2116"> you will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines which are now unrealistic . </seg>
<seg id="2117"> we accept that circumstances have changed , and will work to set new targets and timelines where appropriate . </seg>
<seg id="2118"> what happens with the APP ( Annual Planning ) ? </seg>
<seg id="2119"> to adjust to our new reality and daily working hour expectations , we intend to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan . </seg>
<seg id="2120"> our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgeting to allow employees to prioritize critical work , self-care , and care for loved ones while accommodating those who need or wish to work a reduced schedule over the next few weeks . </seg>
<seg id="2121"> this timeline extension greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the whole organization . </seg>
<seg id="2122"> we will introduce our proposal to the Board next week and will update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation . </seg>
<seg id="2123"> thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this . </seg>
<seg id="2124"> Office status , <term id="210" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="exposure" tgt="exposition|exposées"> exposure </term> , and cleaning </seg>
<seg id="2125"> last week , we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the <term id="151" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="COVID-19 virus" tgt="virus du COVID-19|virus COVID-19"> COVID-19 virus </term> . </seg>
<seg id="2126"> however , out of an abundance of caution , we employed an antiviral cleaning crew to disinfect all <term id="556" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="surfaces" tgt="surfaces"> surfaces </term> in the San Francisco office . </seg>
<seg id="2127"> they utilized a hospital-grade anti-viral solution to disinfect every <term id="354" type="src_original_and_tgt_lemma" src="surface" tgt="superficielles|surface"> surface </term> , as well as the lobby and elevator banks accessing our floor . </seg>
<seg id="2128"> the building is employing its own duty-of-care protocol utilizing products that support the safety of their tenants . </seg>
<seg id="2129"> we feel comfortable that the office will be well-prepared for when we decide to return . </seg>
<seg id="2130"> our DC office is located in a WeWork , which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members . </seg>
<seg id="2131"> as of last week , our DC office moved to a fully remote setup in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco . </seg>
<seg id="2132"> as some of our NYC-based colleagues know , we have also been in discussion about leasing a location in Brooklyn . </seg>
<seg id="2133"> these discussions are continuing but may be delayed . </seg>
<seg id="2134"> some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time . </seg>
<seg id="2135"> our long-time remote colleagues know that it can be an adjustment , and wanted to offer you some advice : </seg>
<seg id="2136"> limit the length of meetings to at most one or two hour increments . </seg>
<seg id="2137"> if longer sessions are required , consider how they can be broken up over the course of several days . </seg>
<seg id="2138"> clearly define the meeting , have an agenda , and send reading materials in advance . </seg>
<seg id="2139"> make video the default , with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection . </seg>
<seg id="2140"> have a lead to facilitate every meeting , someone to monitor the chat for questions and track the speaker list , and someone to help take notes ( or do collaborative note-taking ) . </seg>
<seg id="2141"> send an email to tech support if you need a comfortable headset . </seg>
<seg id="2142"> use your wellness reimbursement for snacks . </seg>
<seg id="2143"> join the # remoties channel in Slack to talk with your colleagues about distributed work </seg>
<seg id="2144"> the HR Operations team is looking into webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation . </seg>
<seg id="2145"> this past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events , such as editathons , until the <term id="22" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="WHO" tgt="OMS"> WHO </term> declares the <term id="260" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="pandemic" tgt="pandémie"> pandemic </term> to be over . </seg>
<seg id="2146"> we let them know that we understood that our request for cancellations and other <term id="534" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="restrictions" tgt="restrictions"> restrictions </term> could make it impossible to complete their agreed-upon grant activities and that no one would be penalized for having to delay or modify those goals . </seg>
<seg id="2147"> this coming week we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences . </seg>
<seg id="2148"> the general sentiment from around the global community seems to be both sadness at the disruption but relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities , Wikimedia and otherwise . </seg>
<seg id="2149"> going forward , the CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them . </seg>
<seg id="2150"> staying in touch around COVID-19 related issues </seg>
<seg id="2151"> we ’ ll be sending an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday , 14 : 00 UTC / 07 : 00 PT for a special staff meeting . </seg>
<seg id="2152"> we ’ ll use this time to share additional <term id="574" type="src_original_and_tgt_original" src="updates" tgt="mises à jour"> updates </term> , answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other . </seg>
<seg id="2153"> we ’ re in this together and here to help however we can . </seg>
<seg id="2154"> in the meantime , you can continue to find the information from this email , and all other essential COVID-19 related information , on Office Wiki . </seg>
<seg id="2155"> the CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place . </seg>
<seg id="2156"> we are also working to maintain regular communications with staff who reside in countries that are currently significantly affected . </seg>
<seg id="2157"> if you have any questions about travel , events , a major Workstream , or coverage challenge , or anything else you may need help with , please don ’ t hesitate to notify and work with the CRT . </seg>
<seg id="2158"> we ’ re here to help provide support and liaise as needed . </seg>
<seg id="2159"> if you have a confidential or sensitive matter , please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations . </seg>
<seg id="2160"> none of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our work and obligations . </seg>
<seg id="2161"> rather , they are a recognition that at this moment , our work and obligations will likely need to adapt in a way we have not in the past . </seg>
<seg id="2162"> these are the steps we believe are necessary to support this one another so that we can continue to work , provide our movement with the support they need , and the world with the service they rely on . </seg>
<seg id="2163"> our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes . </seg>
<seg id="2164"> for now , it is time to support one another and create space for the important work that will be coming in the weeks and potentially months ahead . </seg>
<seg id="2165"> we need all of you to make that happen , and so we need you all to take care of yourself and your families so that you can be at your best when the need arises . </seg>

<seg id="2456"> Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance . </seg>

<seg id="2459"> extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have sunset clauses ; </seg>
<seg id="2460"> the use of data would have to be limited to COVID-19 purposes ; </seg>

<seg id="2466"> the proposed Google / Apple plan intends to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating systems once it is no longer needed . </seg>

<seg id="2481"> SafeTrace utilizes secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials , without compromising the privacy of that data . </seg>
<seg id="2482"> on 5 April 2020 , the global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that had coalesced around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols , with the goal to reduce fragmentation , and enable global interoperability of tracing and alerting apps , a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption . </seg>
